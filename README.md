### Notes
One challenge that I encountered was making sure that I was coding in the correct file because most of the files began with "Movie" and I accidentally added my code to the wrong file at one point.

### Notes
The challenges I encountered while building this project was playing with the constraints so that the images and the texts would fit in each row. Another obstacle was making sure that each line of code was correct because one mistake can affect the entire code.
